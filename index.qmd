  This book will teach you how to program in R, with hands-on examples. I 
  wrote it for non-programmers to provide a friendly introduction  to the R
  language. You'll learn how to load data, assemble and disassemble data 
  objects, navigate R's environment system, write your own functions, and
  use all of R's programming tools. Throughout the book, you'll use your
  newfound skills to solve practical data science problems.
